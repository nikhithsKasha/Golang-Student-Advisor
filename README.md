# Golang-Student-Advisor
This has a graphical user interface which does the following:

Open and save student record files.
Allow a student to specify their starting semester. (Term and Year)
List the courses required for the given major.
Allow a student to select the term and year they would like to take the course. Note that this should not be free-form but some kind of drop down list (you do not have to worry about when a course is actually offered.) The lists should only show the terms where the student is eligible to take a class.
Set grades for the course.
Display the Student's GPA
Additional features (such as projecting minimum and maximum GPA, sorting the courses by planned semester, or creating a major editor) will earn extra credit according to its complexity.
